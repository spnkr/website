- A new citation optimiser is now available.  It recommends who you might want to consider fully equipping and who to fully cite to improve your voyages. 
- Check it out now from the Player Tools tab.
- This is only a guide, spend your citations wisely!<!-- end -->

The citation optimiser does not perform full voyage simulations on its recommendations, so for very strong rosters, recommendations may be poor.  Instead a very rough approximation to a voyage is calculated for each voyage skill combo by summing the scores of the relevant skills and weighting for occurance of each skill.  This process is then repeated for your crew once fully equipped and then again for fully fused.

Note that for citation the assumption is that you will cite a crew to 5/5 stars, so this tool does not answer "where should I spend the next citation for most improvement", it answers "who should I cite to 5/5 for most improvement", as one citation on a killer 1/5 may have no effect on your voyages, but at 5/5 they might become your best crew.
