In the face of a poor voyage skill set, Youhura's strong debut numbers and nice traits bought her a little extra time in that area and she should hang with the new hotness longer than most CMD/DIP/SUCK.

When excused from there, her plus skill set, which has produced thin value as of this writing, looks primed to be the beneficiary of WRG's collection era and can help supplement Uhura's modest event clip and shuttle-oriented skill set. Her usage will vary from roster to roster, but she's a fine mid-level speculative investment.
